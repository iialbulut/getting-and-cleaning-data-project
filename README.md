"Happy families are all alike; every
unhappy family is unhappy in its own
way" (Tolstoy)
"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way." (Hadley Wickham)
The purpose of this project is making 7 dataset merge and create a readable tidy data set.

For this we follow;
  1- Merging train and test data
  2- Extraction of required columns with mean and standard deviation measuremet
  3- Then use the activity labels for defining the head of the measurements
  4- Thenn arrange the colunm names in a descriptive way
  5- Creating independent tidy data sets
